## Lecture, Part Two: Manipulating CSS

Once we have an element in our sites, we probably want to do something with it, right?

In this case, let's add some CSS styling. Let's say we wanted to grab all of the Federalist presidents and turn their font color pink. We could do something like this:

```js
$('.federalist').css('color', 'pink');
```

One thing you might have noticed about CSS is that it really likes hyphens. So, to change a background color, you would use `background-color`. The thing about hyphens is that they are a no-no in JavaScript. So, we *should* to camel-case our property names in our CSS methods.

```js
$('.federalist').css('backgroundColor', 'pink');
```

You'll notice I said "should" instead of must. At the end of the day that's just a string. You can do it the other way, but it's against convention.

```js
$('.federalist').css('background-color', 'pink');
```

Right now, we're setting individual properties. We can also pass in a conditional object in order to change multiple CSS attributes all at once.

```js
$('.federalist').css({
  backgroundColor: 'pink',
  fontWeight: 'bold'
});
```

If you ignored me earlier and insisted on using hyphens, you're going to have to wrap those property names in quotes now. Yuck.

Writing CSS by hand is probably a bad idea. We're better off using classes to style our content.

We can add and remove classes pretty easily in jQuery.

```js
$('.federalist').addClass('red');
$('.federalist').removeClass('red');
```

Keeping track of state is hard. jQuery is here to help.

```js
$('.federalist').hasClass('federalist'); // Returns true, obviously.
```

The other option is to use `toggleClass`, which will either add or remove the class depending on whether or not the class currently exists.

```js
$('.federalist').toggleClass('red');
```


## Exercise, Part Two: Style the Presidents

* Add the class of `red` to all of the Republicans.
* Add the class of `blue` to all of the Democrats.
* Add the class of `yellow` to the term column of the table.
* Take all the whig presidents and give them a purple background and white text.

(This should take 10 minutes.)
